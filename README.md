This repo contains pre-built images for altEnv. This is intended to save time, but you're encouraged to play around and build your own.

The structure of this repo is: Arch/Brand/Image

Instructions to get up and running:

1. Copy archive file to your altEnv/environments directory.
2. Extract it: tar xf <archive>.tar.xz

That's it. Rename the directory if you wish. altEnv will now find it by default and you should be able to run it without any modifications.
